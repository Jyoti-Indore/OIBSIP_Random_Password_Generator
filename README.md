# 🔐 Random Password Generator

## 🌟 Oasis Infobyte Internship – Task 2

This is my second task as part of the **Oasis Infobyte Internship Program**, where I have built a **Command-Line Random Password Generator** using Python. The tool allows users to generate strong and secure passwords based on their preferences for length and character types (letters, numbers, symbols).

---

## 🚀 Features

- Choose your desired **password length**
- Option to include:
  - ✅ Letters (uppercase and lowercase)
  - ✅ Numbers (0–9)
  - ✅ Symbols (!@#$%^&*)
- Ensures high-level security and randomness
- Runs smoothly in any Python-supported terminal

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. User is prompted to enter:
   - Desired length of the password
   - Whether to include letters, numbers, and/or symbols
2. The script validates input and generates a password using the selected criteria.
3. Displays the final secure password.

## 📁 Files Included

- `Random_Password_Generator.ipynb` – The Colab Notebook version of the project.
- `password_generator.py` *(optional if converted)* – A Python script version of the generator.
- `README.md` – Project documentation.

## 💡 Sample Output

```bash
🔐 Welcome to the Python Password Generator!
Enter desired password length: 12
Include the following in your password:
Letters? (y/n): y
Numbers? (y/n): y
Symbols? (y/n): n

Your generated password: A8dZ3bWcQ7fL
```
